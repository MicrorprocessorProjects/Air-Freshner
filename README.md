# Air-Freshner
Project of Michael and Donny. 

Topic 14.5 from "Programmable Microcontrollers With Applications" by Unsalan and Gurhan 
>p< The purpose of this project was to use timers and low-power modes to design an air freshener dispenser system. The project required  five LEDs, five 220 resistors, three push buttons and two 100-nF capacitors.
Our goal during this project is to implement a simulation of an air freshener with three different functions. One function of the air freshener is short() which disperse the spray from the air freshener(LED) for a duration of 5 seconds. The second function is medium() which disperse the spray from the air freshener(LED) for a duration of 10 seconds. The third function is long() which disperse the spray from the air freshener(LED) for a duration of 15 seconds.
